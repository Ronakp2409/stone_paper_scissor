I am an experienced ETL/Data Engineer with over 4 years of expertise in ETL development, data migration, and data warehousing. 
I am currently working as a Data Engineer Analyst at Accenture
I have hands-on experience working with IBM InfoSphere DataStage, leveraging Change Data Capture (CDC) for seamless data movement between OLTP and OLAP 
systems.
Throughout my career, I have been involved in end-to-end ETL implementation, working on data pipeline optimization, performance tuning,
and cloud-based data integration using Google Cloud (BigQuery, Cloud Storage) and AWS services. Additionally, 
I have worked extensively with Informatica PowerCenter, IICS, SQL Server, Oracle Database, and DB2 to design and implement scalable ETL solutions.
I have a strong track record of collaborating with cross-functional teams, ensuring smooth data transformation and migration 
while maintaining high-quality standards. My expertise also includes scheduling tools like Control-M and workflow automation to streamline processes 
efficiently.
With my problem-solving mindset, hands-on technical experience, and ability to work in fast-paced environments,
I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to IBMâ€™s data engineering and ETL initiatives.
I look forward to discussing how my skills can add value to the team.
